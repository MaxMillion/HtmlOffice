  WebODF is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) and
  also available under other licenses from KO GmbH on request. The AGPL license
  guarantees the rights of users of software. In contrast to many software
  licenses used for mainstream office suites, WebODF respects the freedom of
  users. WebODF can be used, modified and shared as long as the recipients of
  the software recieve the same rights as stipulated in the AGPL.

  We have added two clauses to the AGPL that ensure that the compiled version
  of the WebODF library can be used in many websites, mobile and desktop applications
  without requiring the distribution of said websites and applications under
  the same license terms as the AGPL. This is the text that is included in
  the software webodf.js:

  The code in this file is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
  WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or

  As additional permission under GNU AGPL version 3 section 7, you may distribute
  UNMODIFIED VERSIONS OF THIS file without the copy of the GNU AGPL normally required
  by section 4, provided you include this license notice and a URL through which
  recipients can access the Corresponding Source.

  As a special exception to the AGPL, any HTML file which merely makes function
  calls to this code, and for that purpose includes it in unmodified form by reference
  or in-line shall be deemed a separate work for copyright law purposes. In addition,
  the copyright holders of this code give you permission to combine this code with
  free software libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL. You may copy and
  distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU AGPL for this code and
  the LGPL for the libraries. If you modify this code, you may extend this exception
  to your version of the code, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not
  wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

  This license applies to this entire compilation.
